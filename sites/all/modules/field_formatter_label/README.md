FIELD FORMATTER LABEL
=====================

Alters in an option to every field formatter settings form to override the field
label. This allows different labels in different view modes.

This module intentionally works with field_display_label module. Together they
allow for the display label to be specified on the field edit form and the
override in the Manage Fields UI is optional.


History
-------

This module is based off code from the field_display_label module. It has been
modified to put the label field in the formatters settings form rather than on
the field configuration form.
